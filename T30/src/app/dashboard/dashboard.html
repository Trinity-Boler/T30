  <h1>CleanPlay: Greener Gaming for a Sustainable Future</h1>

  <p>
    CleanPlay is a recent innovation launched in early 2025 that brings clean energy
    awareness directly to the gaming community. The platform allows players to offset
    the power their consoles use by subscribing to renewable energy sources such as wind
    and solar. It integrates with gaming systems like the PlayStation 5, rewarding users
    with exclusive in-game items, achievements, and digital collectibles for supporting
    clean power. This approach transforms gaming from being purely energy-consuming to
    being environmentally conscious and participatory. CleanPlay partners with energy
    providers and developers to verify renewable offsets, turning every gaming session
    into a contribution toward a cleaner energy grid. It represents a new intersection
    between entertainment technology and environmental responsibility, using gamification
    to inspire positive change within one of the largest digital industries.

  <h2>Technical Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The T30 project is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using <strong>Angular</strong>
    for the frontend, <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Express</strong> for the backend API,
    and <strong>MongoDB</strong> for the database. The site is hosted on <strong>NGINX</strong>
    for efficient static file serving and HTTPS configuration. The architecture follows
    a modern MERN-like stack but leverages Angular for improved modularity and scalability.
    Environment variables are managed with <code>dotenv</code>, and RESTful endpoints are used
    to fetch and display data dynamically from MongoDB.
