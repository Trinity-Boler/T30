      <h1>CleanPlay: Greener Gaming for a Sustainable Future</h1>
      <a href="https://cleanplay.com/" target="_blank">CleanPlay</a>

      <p>
        CleanPlay is an innovation launched in early 2025 that brings clean energy
        awareness directly to the gaming community. The platform enables players to offset
        the power their consoles use by subscribing to renewable energy sources such as
        wind and solar.
      </p>

      <p>
        It integrates with gaming systems like the PlayStation 5, rewarding players with
        exclusive in-game items, achievements, and digital collectibles for supporting
        clean power. This turns gaming from being purely energy-consuming into a more
        environmentally conscious and participatory experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        CleanPlay partners with energy providers and developers to verify renewable
        offsets, ensuring that every gaming session contributes to a cleaner and more
        sustainable energy grid. It represents a new intersection between entertainment
        technology and environmental responsibility, using gamification to encourage
        positive change within one of the largest digital industries.

      <h2>Technical Overview</h2>

      <p>
        The T30 project is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using
        <strong>Angular</strong> for the frontend, <strong>Node.js</strong> and
        <strong>Express</strong> for the backend API, and <strong>MongoDB</strong> for the
        database. The site is hosted on <strong>NGINX</strong> for efficient static file
        serving and HTTPS configuration.
      </p>

      <p>
        The architecture follows a modern MERN-like stack but uses Angular for improved
        modularity and scalability. Environment variables are handled with
        <code>dotenv</code>, and RESTful endpoints fetch and display data dynamically
        from MongoDB.
      </p>

      <p>
        The charts are created with <strong>Chart.js</strong>, providing interactive visualizations.
        Chart.js is utilized for rendering interactive charts on the Summary and Report
        pages, providing visual insights into CleanPlay adoption and energy distribution.
        User authentication is managed with <strong>JWT</strong> tokens stored in local storage for
        session persistence.
